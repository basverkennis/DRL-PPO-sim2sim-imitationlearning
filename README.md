# Deep Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning with sim2sim exploration and behavior cloning

This repository contains the code and models for the "Deep Reinforcement Learning Assignment" by my professor, Giacomo Spigler. The assignment explores deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques in sim2sim and imitation learning. 

### Part 1 - SIM2SIM - GENERALIZATION OF TRAINED POLICIES TO DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT DYNAMICS
Part 1 focuses on generalizing trained policies to different environment dynamics, in this case: torso mass, using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. Hyperparameter tuning with Optuna is used for effective exploration. And HuggingFace (2023) state-of-the-art baseline hyperparameters are tested.

### Part 2 - SIM2SIM - IMITATION LEARNING - LEARNING FROM EXPERT DEMONSTRATIONS / BEHAVIOR CLONING
Part 2 investigates behavior cloning (BC) for imitation learning, where a DRL agent is trained on the "Ant-v4" Gym environment using PPO. The impact of expert data and policy network size on BC agent performance is analyzed. The results highlight the importance of sim2sim and imitation learning in training robust policies that generalize well. This work contributes to advancing DRL understanding and offers insights into the optimization and generalization of sim2sim and imitation learning.

The PDF containing the assignment will be published shortly.
